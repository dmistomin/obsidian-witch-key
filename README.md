# Obsidian "Witch Key" Plugin

## What is this?

This plugin is intended to be an alternative to Obsidian's [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette). It works similarly to the Emacs [which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) minor mode or the NeoVim [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) plugin.

So, when you enter the bound `<Leader>` hotkey, this plugin displays a panel with your custom-defined keybinding groups. This panel then updates as you enter new hotkeys, allowing you to organize your Obsidian commands in a personalized and intuitive manner.

At least, _it will work like that eventually!_. Currently, it's very early in development and pre-alpha! So in the unlikely case that you somehow found this and decide to use it, be aware that __it's work-in-progress software and use at your own risk__.
