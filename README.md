# Obsidian "Witch Key" Plugin

## What is this?

This plugin is intended to be an alternative to Obsidian's [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette). It works similarly to the Emacs [which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) minor mode or the NeoVim [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) plugin.

At least, _it will work like that eventually!_. Currently, it's very early in development! So in the unlikely case that you find this and decide to use it, be aware that it's work-in-progress software and use at your own risk.
